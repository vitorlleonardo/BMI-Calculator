# BMI CALCULATOR


BMI Calculator is a project designed to calculate a person's body mass index. The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that relates a person's weight and height, and is widely used to assess whether a person is at a healthy weight or not.

The project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the aim of providing a simple and efficient tool for calculating BMI. The user can enter his weight and height in metric units (kilograms and meters), and the calculation is done automatically. The result is displayed on the screen in real time, with an indication of whether the BMI indicates healthy weight, underweight or overweight.
